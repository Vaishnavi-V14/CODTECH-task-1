Overview of the project

Project:  MODEL EVALUATION AND COMPARISION

Objective
To assess the performance of machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics and compare their effectiveness to identify the most suitable model for a given problem. 
This ensures the model's reliability, accuracy, and generalizability on unseen data.

Key Activities 
•	Define Evaluation Metrics: Select metrics based on the problem type 
•	Train-Test Splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.
•	Model Scoring: Compute evaluation metrics on validation and test sets.
•	Visualization of Results: Plot metrics like confusion matrices, ROC curves, or feature importance for interpretability.

Technology Used
•	Programming Languages: Python
•	Libraries and Frameworks: Python: Scikit-learn
•	Tools for Visualization: Matplotlib
•	Model Validation Tools: Cross-validation tools in Scikit-learn
